# Welcome to my Website

I'm a student at NYU studying Computer Science and Philosophy. 

I was speaking with a friend, and communicated that I had no idea what software engineering actually was. And I doubted that I could actually do it.

He told me to practice by making a website. Connect it to a database, a hosting service, and so on. 

I decided to actually publish it and bought benronen.me.

It's been a lot of fun making this, honestly. Sort of feels like a lego or a puzzle, where I get stuck but can't help just keeping at it.

You can view the Github repo [here](https://github.com/bensronen/my-website).
